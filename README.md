## Rotation Graphs
Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/mfn4zy/anticipating_the_rotation_march_29_2021/) and others by the same author. 
This is a small dash app. It is not yet interactive, but you can adjust the script (dates and ticker list) and then restart the app to visualize the rotations.
I am not 100% confident on the calcualtions yet but they seem to make sense and are headed in the right direction.
